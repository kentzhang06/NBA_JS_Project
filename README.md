# NBA_JS_Project

Background:

NBA players data visualizer
This data visualizer will dynamically display the 30 players, one from each NBA team, stats from the time they joined the league until the present day.
Each team will have one player as a representative of their team aka the face of the team. The home page will be a map of the USA with selectable pins locating each NBA team.
Once a player is selected from the home screen, a dynamically growing bar graph will display the stats of the player from their rookie season to current day.

Functionality:
In NBA Players Stats, users will be able to:

• Clickable selections of a map of the USA with selectable pins for each NBA team
• Zoom in and out closer to the map by scrolling
• Visualize a selected player's stats dynamically grow over the years
• Manually select a year to display total stats or average stats of a player that year

In addition, this project will include:
• Directions on how to use the visualizer
• A production README
